### [1] Representation of any number using r, c
> Any number can be presented as the following

```cpp
n = r + m * c

where: 
n => original number,
r => remainder, 
c => cycle_length,
m => no of cycles
```

### [2] Usage of % with _+ve_ and _-ve_ is different
> The dealing with +ve number and -ve numbers using mod (%) is different

> To use % with -ve numbers or even general number (+ve | -ve) use the following rule.

```cpp
n = (n % MOD + MOD) % MOD

eg.

X (-15 % 12) = -3 // wrong
âœ” ((-15 % 12) + 12) % 12 // right
```

### [3] Facts about %

[1]
```cpp
if (a % n == 0){
 // so a is divisable by n
}
```

[2]
```cpp
if ( a % n == b % n){
  // so, (a - b) % n = 0 AND, n = b - a is the largest n such that a % n = b % n
}
```
